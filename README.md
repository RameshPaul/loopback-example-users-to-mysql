# Loopback Example (MySQL)

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io). I read about 
people wanting to use their own database for the built-in user model and 
decided to see how easy it would be to accomplish. I followed the instructions 
in https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-mysql and built the example 
from scratch, and then edited the User model.

## How To Change Built-In User Model To MySQL Database
 * make sure you have the new MySQL datasource configured from tutorial
 * edit the `/server/model-config.json` file changing built-in models to your new DS
 * create the `/server/bin/automigrate.js` file (should be built from tutorial) and add `automigrate()` functions for each built-in Model
 * run `> node server/bin/automigrate.js` and you should see the following:

~~~
Your-Computer:loopback-example-mysql your-username$ node server/bin/automigrate.js 
User model migrated
ACL model migrated
AccessToken model migrated
Record created: { email: 'foo@bar.com',
  createdAt: Wed Jun 10 2015 08:29:10 GMT-0600 (MDT),
  lastModifiedAt: Wed Jun 10 2015 08:29:10 GMT-0600 (MDT),
  id: 2 }
Record created: { email: 'baz@qux.com',
  createdAt: Wed Jun 10 2015 08:29:10 GMT-0600 (MDT),
  lastModifiedAt: Wed Jun 10 2015 08:29:10 GMT-0600 (MDT),
  id: 1 }
done
Role model migrated
RoleMapping model migrated
~~~

If you check your database, you should now have the tables created and when you use the 
built-in `localhost:3000/explorer` app after starting the app, you can create users and 
they will appear in your database.

Kudos to the team at StrongLoop for building a nice framework and auto-scaffolding. I look 
forward to learning more and hopefully contributing as time permits.
